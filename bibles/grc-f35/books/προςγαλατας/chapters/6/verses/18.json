{"verse":"18","text":"Ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ μετὰ τοῦ πνεύματος ὑμῶν, ἀδελφοί. Ἀμήν.The citation of f35 is based on thirty-seven MSS—18, 35, 201, 204, 328, 386, 394, 444, 604, 757, 824, 928, 986, 1072, 1075, 1100, 1248, 1249, 1503, 1548, 1617, 1637, 1725, 1732, 1761, 1855, 1864, 1865, 1892, 2080, 2352, 2431, 2466, 2554, 2587, 2723 and 2817—all of which I collated myself. 204, 1100, 1637, 1865, 2554 and 2587 are ‘perfect’ representatives of f35 in Galatians, as they stand, as were the exemplars of another five. The uniformity is impressive. Since these MSS come from all over the Mediterranean world (Sinai, Jerusalem, Patmos, Constantinople, Bucharest, Aegean, Trikala, Meteora, Athens, Mt. Athos [eight different monasteries], Grottaferrata, Vatican, etc.) they are certainly representative of the family, giving us the precise family profile—it is reflected in the Text without exception.In the statements of evidence I have included the percentage of manuscript attestation for each variant within either ( ) or [ ]. I have used ( ) for the evidence taken from TuT, which I take to be reasonably precise. For the variant sets that are not covered there I used Reuben Swanson’s excellent collations (New Testament Greek Manuscripts: Galatians [Ed. Reuben Swanson, Wheaton: Tyndale House Publishers, 1999]). For Galatians Swanson collated 78 MSS, six being fragmentary (for any given variant set there will usually be at least 70 MSS listed), and I occasionally supplemented from Scrivener and von Soden—the percentages offered, I have used [ ] for these, are extrapolations based on a comparison of these sources.I venture to predict, if complete collations ever become available, that for any non-Byzantine variants listed with 5 to 1% support (in my apparatus) the margin of error should not exceed ±1%; for non-Byzantine variants listed with 10 to 6% support the margin of error should hardly exceed ±2%; where there is some division among the Byzantine witnesses the margin of error should rarely exceed ±10%—by comparing Swanson with TuT, I believe one can make a fairly accurate extrapolation. However, I guarantee the witness of Family 35. Please see the last footnote for Matthew for further information."}
