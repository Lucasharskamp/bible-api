If the former, the meaning is not common and could easily give rise to the latter. Render: ‘None of this was a delay to Gallio’; Gallio is in the dative. Gallio presumably considered himself to be a busy man and did not appreciate the interruption; he was not about to allow himself to be further delayed. In 22:16 the same verb has the sense of ‘delay’.)"}
