For these verses I will cite the groups posited by von Soden as used in the H-F apparatus, rather than give percentages (M7 becomes f35); however, Robinson’s collations have demonstrated that Soden ‘regularized’ the data rather drastically, so the H-F apparatus may in fact be rather misleading. For all that, until Robinson’s collations are fully analyzed, and the result made public, it’s the best we can do, except that I personally checked all the f35 MSS (in Robinson’s collations) and guarantee that the citation of f35 is correct—it represents 245 MSS in these verses. The two other large groups, M5&6, do exist, although rather ‘fuzzier’ than Soden let on; if the lesser groups, M1,2,3,4, can actually be extracted from the mοrass of variation, they will presumably qualify as secondary developments, based on the three main groups. NU places the whole pericope within [[ ]], which means that it is regarded as a later addition."}
