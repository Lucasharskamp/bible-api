[At least three of the four Alexandrian variants in this verse derive from misunderstanding.] The translations that close the quote after the first ‘works’ don’t make sense. The hypothetical objector has disclaimed faith, so for James to say, “Show me your faith,” doesn’t follow. James clearly teaches salvation by faith, a faith that is alive [if you’re alive you do things]. But an orthodox Jew believes in salvation by works, so here James [who had once been one] anticipates an objection from that quarter. The salvation-by-works person has a different faith.) τῶν ἔργων σου,σου f35 C [92%] RP,HF,OC,TR,CP ¦ --- ℵA,B [8%] NU κἀγὼ δείξω σοιδειξω σοι f35 A,C [92%] RP,HF,OC,TR,CP ¦ ∼ 21 ℵB [8%] NU ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν μου.»μου f35 A [93%] RP,HF,OC,TR,CP ¦ --- ℵB,C [7%] NU ¦ one other variant"}
