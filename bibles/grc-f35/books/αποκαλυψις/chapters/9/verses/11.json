There are three basic questions: how many ‘betas’, ‘alphas’ and ‘deltas’.

Putting it all together, the single vowel appears certain; the evidence for the double ‘beta’ is stronger, as also for the single ‘delta’, except that almost all of the better representatives of f35 have the double delta, while most of the least faithful ones show the single delta, so there is little question but that the family archetype read two deltas, that also have a better geographical distribution. The Hebrew has a double δ but a single β, the reading of OC,NU,TR, but the evidence for ββ is quite strong—probably the archetypal spelling for all three main lines of transmission.) ἐν δὲεν δε f35 Ma,b,d,f,g,i CP,RP,HF,OC ¦ ∼ και 1 Me,h 𝕻47ℵA,NU,TR τῇ Ἑλληνικῇ ὄνομα ἔχει Ἀπολλύων."}
