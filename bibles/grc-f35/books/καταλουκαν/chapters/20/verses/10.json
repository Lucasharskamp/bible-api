By far the more common, the literal meaning of δερω is to skin or flay a dead animal, to beat or whip being a derived meaning. Some have doubted the independent existence of δαιρω, but it occurs in Hermas, sim.6.2.6 [2nd cent.]. The meaning is presumably ‘to beat severely’. That many copyists might change an unfamiliar form to a closely related familiar one is not hard to imagine, but who would change a familiar one to an unfamiliar one?) αὐτὸν ἐξαπέστειλανδηραντες αυτον εξαπεστειλαν f35 A,C(D)N,Q [96.5%] CP,HF,RP,TR,OC ¦ ∼ 321 ℵB [0.3%] NU ¦ 12 απεστειλαν [2.5%] ¦ 1232 W [0.5%] κενόν."}
