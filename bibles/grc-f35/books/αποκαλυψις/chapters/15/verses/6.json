On the other hand, there are at least three heavens, 2 Cor. 12:2, and they may have come out of the third, into the second. This is the only mention of the tabernacle of the testimony in Revelation, so the throne of God wasn’t there and none of the action related by John up to this point took place there—there have been several references to the temple, with angels coming out of it, but I doubt that temple and tabernacle are to be equated.) οἳ ἦσανοι ησαν f35 Ma,b,e⅖,f,g,i CP,RP,HF,OC ¦ --- Md,e⅗,h 𝕻47ℵA,C,NU,TR ἐνδεδυμένοι λίνον καθαρὸν λαμπρὸνλινον καθαρον λαμπρον rell ¦ λινουν 23 𝕻47 ¦ ∼ καθαρους λινους λαμπρους ℵ ¦ λιθον 23 A,C ¦ 12 και 3 TR καὶ περιεζωσμένοι περὶ τὰ στήθη ζώνας χρυσᾶς."}
