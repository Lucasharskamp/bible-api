In 3 John 12 TuT lists ALL 78 basic f35 MSS (±0 to ±3) for οιδαμεν, but Soden does not mention Kr in support of this variant. Since he doesn’t mention Kr anywhere in 3 John, we should not trust his silence. The first person was unexpected and was changed to the expected second person—in the context I would say that the singular is a ‘better’ correction than the plural.) ὅτι ἡ μαρτυρία ἡμῶν ἀληθής ἐστιν."}
