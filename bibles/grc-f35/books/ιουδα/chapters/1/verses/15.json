Certain very evil persons have been rather graphically described in verses 4, 8 and 10-13. In verse 14 Jude introduces a prophecy “about these men”, the same ones he has been describing, and the quotation continues to the end of verse 15. Verse 16 continues the description of their perversity, but verse 17 draws a clear distinction between them and the believers that Jude is addressing. So, Enoch cannot be referring to “every soul”—the NU reading is clearly wrong, introducing an aberration on the flimsiest of evidence. In fact, Nestle25 and UBS2 stayed with the Majority, reading “all the ungodly”. UBS3 changes to “every soul”, without comment! Is this not a curious proceeding? The UBS editors reverse an earlier position, following just three MSS and the Sahidic version, and do not even mention it in their apparatus.] αὐτῶναυτων f35 (80%) RP,HF,OC,TR,CP ¦ --- 𝕻72ℵA,B,C (18.2%) NU ¦ part of a larger omission (1.8%) περὶ πάντων τῶν ἔργων ἀσεβείας αὐτῶν ὧν ἠσέβησαν, καὶ περὶ πάντων τῶν σκληρῶνσκληρων rell ¦ 1 λογων ℵC (14%) ὧν ἐλάλησαν κατ᾿ αὐτοῦ—ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἀσεβεῖς.»"}
