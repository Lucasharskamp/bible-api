Ἀμήν.The citation of f35 for 2 & 3 John and Jude is based on forty-six MSS—18, 35, 141, 149, 201, 204, 328, 386, 394, 432, 444, 604, 664, 757, 824, 928, 986, 1072, 1075, 1100, 1247, 1248, 1249, 1503, 1548, 1628, 1637, 1725, 1732, 1754, 1761, 1768, 1855, 1864, 1865, 1876, 1892, 1897, 2221, 2352, 2431, 2466, 2554, 2587, 2626 and 2723—all of which I collated myself. 141, 204, 386, 824, 928, 1072, 1075, 1100, 1637, 1855, 1864, 2221, 2554 and 2723 are very pure representatives of f35 in these three books, with not a single variant, and so for the exemplars of fourteen others. For all those MSS to have no variants after all the centuries of transmission is surely an eloquent demonstration of the faithfulness and accuracy of that transmission. Since these MSS come from all over the Mediterranean world (Sinai, Jerusalem, Patmos, Constantinople, Bucharest, Aegean, Trikala, Athens, Meteora, Sparta, Ochrida, Mt. Athos [nine different monasteries], Grottaferrata, Vatican, etc.) they are certainly representative of the family, giving us the precise family profile—it is reflected in the Text without exception. For Jude I used Tommy Wasserman’s complete collation of over 500 MSS (The Epistle of Jude: Its Text and Transmission, Almqvist & Wiksell International, 2006), so I imagine the percentages given are very close to the true picture. For 2&3 John I used ECM, extrapolating from a comparison with TuT, which presumably allows a reasonably close approximation. So I venture to predict, if complete collations ever become available, that for any non-Byzantine variants listed with 5 to 1% support (in my apparatus) the margin of error should not exceed ±1%; for non-Byzantine variants listed with 10 to 6% support the margin of error should hardly exceed ±3%; where there is some division among the Byzantine witnesses the margin of error should rarely exceed ±10%. However, I guarantee the witness of f35, that represents around 17% of the total of extant MSS for these books. Please see the last footnote for Matthew for further information."}
