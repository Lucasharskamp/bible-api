{"verse":"9","text":"Ἰδού, δίδωμιδιδωμι rell ¦ διδω A,C,NU ¦ δεδωκα ℵ ἐκ τῆς συναγωγῆς τοῦ Σατανᾶ, τῶν λεγόντων ἑαυτοὺς Ἰουδαίους εἶναι καὶ οὐκ εἰσίν, ἀλλὰ ψεύδονται—ἰδού, ποιήσω αὐτοὺς ἵνα ἥξουσινηξουσιν f35 Ma⅙,d⅔,e⅕,f⅖,h⅓ ℵA,C,CP,OC,NU ¦ ηξωσιν Ma,b,c⅖,d⅓,e,f⅗,g,h⅔,i RP,HF,TR (One’s first impression is that the three verbs controlled by ινα are parallel and should be in the same mode, namely subjunctive—γνωσιν is home free, προσκυνησωσιν has a heavy majority [including f35] but with some dissent; with ηξωσιν the dissent becomes stronger, including ⅗ of Family 35 [a preponderance of the better representatives read the indicative]. The generalized splitting suggests that the ‘norm’ of subjunctive with ινα was at work in the minds of the copyists, the more so since the other two verbs are in that mode; but the indicative isn’t all that infrequent, and in this case presumably emphasizes certainty—they will come.) καὶ προσκυνήσωσινπροσκυνησωσιν f35 Ma,b,d⅔,e,f,g,h,i⅔ CP,RP,HF,TR ¦ προσκυνησουσιν Mb⅕,d⅓,e⅕,h¼,i⅓ ℵA,C,OC,NU ἐνώπιον τῶν ποδῶν σου καὶ γνῶσιν ὅτιοτι f35 Ma,b,f,h¼,i CP,RP,HF ¦ 1 εγω Md,e,g,h ℵA,C,OC,NU,TR ἠγάπησά σε."}
