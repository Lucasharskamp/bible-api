Ἀμήν.αμην f35 [92%] RP,HF,OC,TR,CP ¦ --- 𝕻46ℵA,B [8%] NU,The citation of f35 is based on the following thirty-six MSS—18, 35, 141, 201, 204, 328, 386, 432, 444, 757, 824, 928, 986, 1072, 1075, 1100, 1249, 1482, 1503, 1548, 1617, 1637, 1652, 1725, 1740, 1855, 1864, 1865, 1892, 1897, 2352, 2431, 2466, 2554, 2587 and 2723—all of which I collated myself. 2554 is a ‘perfect’ representative of f35 in 2 Corinthians, as it stands, as were the exemplars of 1865 and 2723. For a book this size the uniformity is impressive. Since these MSS come from all over the Mediterranean world (Sinai, Jerusalem, Aegean, Patmos, Constantinople, Bucharest, Trikala, Meteora, Athens, Mt. Athos [seven different monasteries], Grottaferrata, Vatican, etc.) they are certainly representative of the family, giving us the precise family profile—it is reflected in the Text without exception. In the statements of evidence I have included the percentage of manuscript attestation for each variant within either ( ) or [ ]. I have used ( ) for the evidence taken from TuT, which I take to be reasonably precise. For the variant sets that are not covered there I used Reuben Swanson’s excellent collations (New Testament Greek Manuscripts: 2 Corinthians [Ed. Reuben Swanson, Carol Stream, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 2005]). For 2 Corinthians Swanson collated 83 MSS, five being fragmentary (for any given variant set there will usually be at least 75 MSS listed), and I occasionally supplemented from Scrivener and von Soden—the percentages offered, I have used [ ] for these, are extrapolations based on a comparison of these sources. I venture to predict, if complete collations ever become available, that for any non-Byzantine variants listed with 5 to 1% support (in my apparatus) the margin of error should not exceed ±1%; for non-Byzantine variants listed with 10 to 6% support the margin of error should hardly exceed ±2%; where there is some division among the Byzantine witnesses the margin of error should rarely exceed ±10%—by comparing Swanson with TuT, I believe one can make a fairly accurate extrapolation. However, I guarantee the witness of Family 35. Please see the last footnote for Matthew for further information."}]}
