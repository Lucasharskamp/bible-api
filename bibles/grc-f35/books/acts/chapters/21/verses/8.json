The first variant best fits the context—since the beginning of the chapter, and before, the main participants have been presented in the first person plural. The closest finite verb on each side of the variant in question is εμειναμεν, 1st plural. The information in the second variant is unnecessary but not objectionable; if it were original there would be no need to change it. Of course, if the first variant were original there would be no need to change it either, unless some felt it was time to remind the reader who “we” was referring to. More likely it was the influence of the Lectionaries, since they have precisely the second variant (while all three ancient versions have the first one). εἰς Καισάρειαν· καὶ εἰσελθόντες εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φιλίππου τοῦ εὐαγγελιστοῦευαγγελιστου rell ¦ 1 του [5%] TR (ὄντος ἐκ τῶν ἑπτά), ἐμείναμεν παρ᾿ αὐτῷ."}
