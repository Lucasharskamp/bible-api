{"verse":"33","text":"Πλὴν καὶ ὑμεῖς οἱ καθ᾿ ἕνα·καθ᾿ ἑνα rell ¦ καθένα f35 (I include this for the record and so as not to lose sight of it, but since there is evidently no difference in meaning I stay with the conventional spelling. Since the shift from τ to θ is caused by aspiration, there is no ambiguity). ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα οὕτως ἀγαπάτω ὡς ἑαυτόν, ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἵνα φοβῆται τὸν ἄνδρα."}
