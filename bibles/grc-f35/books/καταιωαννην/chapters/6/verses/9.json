{"verse":"9","text":"«Ἔστιν παιδάριον ἓνεν f35 A [97%] CP,HF,RP,OC,TR ¦ --- 𝕻66,75ℵB,D,N,W [3%] NU ὧδεὧδε rell ¦ ὦδε f35 (I include this information for the record and so as not to lose sight of it, but since there is apparently no difference in meaning, I stay with the conventional pointing. However, in most manuscripts the difference between ὧδε and ᾧ δε is not clear, and the expedient adopted by f35 removes the ambiguity. A similar statement obtains wherever the word occurs.) ὃο f35 ℵN [97%] CP,HF,RP,TR ¦ ος 𝕻66A,B,D,W [3%] OC,NU ¦ two other readings ἔχει πέντε ἄρτους κριθίνους καὶ δύο ὀψάρια, ἀλλὰ ταῦτα τί ἐστιν εἰς τοσούτους;»"}
