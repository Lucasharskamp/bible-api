Unless an uncial consistently marks breathing, the absence of a mark cannot be trusted.) [When Jehovah changed Abram’s name to Abraham (Genesis 17:5) the intervocalic aspiration in Hebrew is adequately represented in English by ‘h’; but so far as I know, there is no way in Greek to indicate intervocalic aspiration within a word—the only alternative to losing the aspiration altogether would be to place it at the beginning of the word, as f35 does.] ‹ἐπίστευσεν τῷ Θεῷ καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην.›"}
