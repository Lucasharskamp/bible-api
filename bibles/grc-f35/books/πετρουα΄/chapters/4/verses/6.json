{"verse":"6","text":"(εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ καὶ νεκροῖς εὐηγγελίσθη, ἵνα κριθῶσι μὲν κατὰ ἀνθρώπους σαρκί, ζῶσι δὲ κατὰ Θεὸν πνεύματι).[This delightful verse has given commentators no end of exercise. Verse 5 ends with “judge living and dead”, but anyone who is dead was once alive, obviously, and the judgment will be based on what they did while alive, which is why everyone needs to be evangelized while in this life. There is no definite article with ‘dead’, either in verse 5 or 6, so Peter is referring to the ones who were evangelized in this life—he is not saying that everyone has been or will be evangelized. Everyone will be judged, but to ‘live according to God in spirit’ one must respond adequately to the Gospel.]"}
