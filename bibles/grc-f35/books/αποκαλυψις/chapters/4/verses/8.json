It seems clear from verse 9 that it is only the four living beings who are repeating ‘holy’, but if copyists thought the elders were in chorus with the living beings, they would naturally change the gender to masculine. In spite of the split in f35, most of the better representatives of the family attest the first variant.) «Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος· Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος· Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος·αγιος (nine times) f35 Ma⅔,b,f (ℵ)CP,HF ¦ αγιος (three times) Ma⅓,d,e,g,h,i A,RP,OC,NU,TR (Surely it is more likely that ‘nine’ would be changed to ‘three’ than vice versa; in fact, try reading ‘holy’ nine times in a row out loud—it starts to get uncomfortable! Since in the context the living ones are repeating themselves endlessly, the ‘nine’ is both appropriate and effective; three ‘holies’ for each member of the Trinity.)
