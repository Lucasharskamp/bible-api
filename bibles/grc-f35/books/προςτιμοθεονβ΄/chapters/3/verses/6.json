The basic meaning of ενδυω is ‘to enter’, which over time was obscured by the statistically predominant use with reference to entering clothes (in English we speak of ‘putting on’ clothes), except that for this use the verb is normally in the middle voice, not the active, as here. But in the context the description of such persons, given in verses 2-5, does not agree with ‘sneaking’ or ‘worming’—they enter openly, exuding confidence and competence. ενδυω is probably correct.) εἰς τὰς οἰκίας καὶ αἰχμαλωτίζοντεςαιχμαλωτιζοντες f35 ℵA,C [50%] OC,CP,NU ¦ αιχμαλωτευοντες [45%] RP,HF,TR ¦ αιχμαλωτευον [5%] γυναικάριαγυναικαρια f35 ℵA,C [85%] RP,HF,OC,CP,NU ¦ τα 1 [15%] TR σεσωρευμένα ἁμαρτίαις, ἀγόμενα ἐπιθυμίαις ποικίλαις,"}
